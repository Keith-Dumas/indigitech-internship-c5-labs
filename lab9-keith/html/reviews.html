                <h3>Super Mario Bros.</h3>
                <p>Trevor Hart, 4 years ago</p>
            <p>This game is ICONIC. Sure, the graphics are blocky. Sure, Mario's overalls aren't blue, but it's still an iconic game. Not only did Mario save Princess Toadstool on this adventure, he saved the American video game industry after the crash that happened 2 years before the game came out. Thanks, Nintendo! Story: Basic, but still great. Bowser, King of the Koopa, has used black magic to turn mushroom people ("Toads") into the blocks in the sky ("?" Blocks, Brick Blocks, etc.), and to reverse the spell, Bowser has captured Princess Toadstool. Enemies: Good amount of classic bad guys, such as Goombas and Koopa Troopas. Level Design: Great levels with lots of hidden powerups, like Super Stars, and 1-UP Mushrooms. Music/SFX: One of the BEST game soundtracks ever!! The overworld theme has become the main theme of the Mario franchise for years to come. The sound effects are very satisfying, such as the sound of squishing a Goomba. Overall, I'd give this game a PERFECT 10, because of its importance, and its timeless gameplay and music.</p>

                <h3>Sonic the Hedgehog</h3>
                <p>This game is great, if you want to know for yourself go play it. There are several ways to get it but its worth it. Sonic is a great game, I recommend it to anyone. Its fast, fun, and challenging. Go play it. I give it a perfect score. The game stars Sonic the Hedgehog trying to stop Dr. Eggman from getting the Chaso Emeralds and ruling South Island. This game is classic. Go play it, its available for download on the Wii's Virtual Console, Xbox Live Arcade, and many great compilation games, you can even probably buy the original cartridge online even.
                I recommend this game to any gamer in the US, Japan, and Europe. Please go pick it up and play it, it's great, outstanding, one of the best game of all time, and is better than the newer games, so please go pick it up.</p>

                <h3>Metroid</h3>
                <p>The original Metroid is archaic to say the least. It is however, the first game in the franchise, and is worth playing on that basis.  You will come to appreciate all of the updates future games-not just Metroid games but other games inspired by Metroid- will bring to the formula. If you are a Metroid, or metroidvania, enthusiast, then this is a must for your collection. Otherwise, this will only serve to satisfy one's curiosity about the humble beginnings of Metroid.</p>
