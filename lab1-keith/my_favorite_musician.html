        <h2>Why I like Bôa</h2>
        <p>Bôa's music has always spoken to me the tone, instruments and lyrics all convey a deep message often with a lot of sadness, Indie music in general has always grasped my attention as it feels more real than whatever is popular today. I'm also just a big fan of rock in general. My favorite album from boa is twilight which home to all my favorite songs as well.</p>
