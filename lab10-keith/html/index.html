            <h2>Introuction To Indigenous Sculpting</h2>
            <p>Indigenous sculpting in Canada spans millennia, with traditions rooted in pre-contact practices and evolving through time. Initially, carving was primarily functional, creating tools and objects for daily life. Over time, sculpting became a powerful form of artistic and cultural expression, with Inuit and First Nations artists creating intricate works in stone, wood, and other materials, often imbued with deep symbolism and spiritual meaning. </p>

                <h3>Bill Reid</h3>
                <p>Iljuwas Bill Reid (1920–1998) belonged to Raven-Wolf Clan of the Haida Nation. He is celebrated as one of the most significant Northwest Coast artists of the late twentieth century. While working as a radio broadcaster for the CBC, he established a highly regarded practice as a jeweller; he later became a sculptor of large-scale public works, all while discovering his Haida heritage through the art of his ancestors. Throughout his fifty-year-long career he was prolific as a maker and thinker, creating more than one thousand original works and writing dozens of texts that gave voice to his vision and the cultural issues of his day. A community activist, mentor, and writer, he is remembered as a passionate artist and an advocate for the “well-made object—equal only to the joy in making it.”</p>

                <h3>Tim Paul</h3>
                <p>Tim is a Nuu-Chah-Nulth artist born in 1950 and raised in Esperanza Inlet on Vancouver Island, B.C. He is currently living, making art, and seeking community change from Port Alberni, B.C. He has held the position of First Carver at the Royal British Columbia Museum, where he oversaw numerous commissions for totem poles for international sites such as Wakefield Park and Yorkshire Park in England, Stanley Park in Vancouver, and in Auckland. He left that position to oversee a program focussing on Native education for the Port Alberni School Board and Vancouver Island. In his position there, he developed student workbooks, teacher guides, etc. He has since left that role and is now focused on setting up and Educational Cultural Language Library. In a recent interview with The Steinbrueck Gallery in September 2022, he said, "I've learned that I need to do as much as I can to keep our culture alive. I've realized if I don't do it now, so much of my family will be losing too much."</p>

                <h3>Dempsey Bob</h3>
                <p>Dempsey Bob is a Tahltan Tlingit artist, born at Telegraph Creek on the Stikine River, and is a member of the Wolf clan. He began carving about 1970, first studying with Freda Diesing at Prince Rupert and later, in 1972 and 1974 at the Gitanmaax School of Northwest Coast Indian Art and Design. Although he works in silver and gold, his preferred medium continues to be wood and more recently, bronze. Bob’s pieces are executed with a deft and sure hand, smoothly integrating sculpture and two-dimensional design as they trace the artist’s exploration of the old Tlingit style. On his much sought-after bronze work Bob has this to say: "Bronze has a different feel to it. It's new, and it's a challenge to make it good. Our people were great sculptors. They knew as much about sculpture as any other great cultures in the world. The great old northwest coast pieces in wood would make great bronze sculptures today. Tlingit people made copper masks, frontlets, jewelry and rattles, and bronze in 90% copper". Beyond his role as a renowned artist, Dempsey Bob has played an important part in inspiring the next generation of Northwest Coast artists. He is the senior advisor at the Northwest Community College (NWCC) Freda Diesing School of Northwest Coast Art.</p>
