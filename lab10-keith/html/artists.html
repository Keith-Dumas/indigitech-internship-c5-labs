                <h3>Lucy Tasseor Tutsweetok</h3>
                <p>Lucy Tasseor Tutsweetok (1934–2012) was a celebrated carver from Nunalla, MB who eventually made Arviat, NU her home and artistic community. Tustweetok grew up with her grandparents, who greatly influenced her art however she did not start carving until she moved to Arviat in the 1960s. Tutsweetok’s sculptures dramatically range in size from the length of a thumb to larger boulders. She worked with basalt and, on occasion, caribou antler—often leaving large portions of the material un-carved and unpolished. Occasionally, Tutsweetok would incised drawings, such as the igloo on the piece Mother and Children (1960), onto her sculptures. Turning her art production into a family affair, her husband, three children and grandchildren frequently assisted with filing and polishing her works</p>

                <h3>Jim Hart</h3>
                <p>Jim Hart is one of the most established and prominent Northwest Coast artists in Canada. His is some of the most beautiful and intricate work in the Northwest Coast art world. At the beginning of his impressive career, which has spanned several decades, Hart worked with renowned Haida artists Robert Davidson and Bill Reid. In doing so he participated in the creation of some of the best known contemporary Northwest Coast artworks in Canada, including "The Raven and the First Men" by Bill Reid at the Museum of Anthropology in Vancouver. Most recently he completed his largest project to date, "The Dance Screen (The Scream Too). It measures 11' x 16' and is a testament to his extraordinarily fine carving. Hart comes from a long line of Haida chiefs who were carvers. As Chief of the Eagle Clan since 1999, he holds the name and hereditary title of his great-great-grandfather, Charles Edenshaw: 7idansuu. For this occasion he held a potlatch and raised a 55' totem pole in Massett, on Haida Gwaii.</p>

                <h3>Bill Reid</h3>
                <p>Iljuwas Bill Reid (1920–1998) belonged to Raven-Wolf Clan of the Haida Nation. He is celebrated as one of the most significant Northwest Coast artists of the late twentieth century. While working as a radio broadcaster for the CBC, he established a highly regarded practice as a jeweller; he later became a sculptor of large-scale public works, all while discovering his Haida heritage through the art of his ancestors. Throughout his fifty-year-long career he was prolific as a maker and thinker, creating more than one thousand original works and writing dozens of texts that gave voice to his vision and the cultural issues of his day. A community activist, mentor, and writer, he is remembered as a passionate artist and an advocate for the “well-made object—equal only to the joy in making it.”</p>

                <h3>Dempsey Bob</h3>
                <p>Dempsey Bob is a Tahltan Tlingit artist, born at Telegraph Creek on the Stikine River, and is a member of the Wolf clan. He began carving about 1970, first studying with Freda Diesing at Prince Rupert and later, in 1972 and 1974 at the Gitanmaax School of Northwest Coast Indian Art and Design. Although he works in silver and gold, his preferred medium continues to be wood and more recently, bronze. Bob’s pieces are executed with a deft and sure hand, smoothly integrating sculpture and two-dimensional design as they trace the artist’s exploration of the old Tlingit style. On his much sought-after bronze work Bob has this to say: "Bronze has a different feel to it. It's new, and it's a challenge to make it good. Our people were great sculptors. They knew as much about sculpture as any other great cultures in the world. The great old northwest coast pieces in wood would make great bronze sculptures today. Tlingit people made copper masks, frontlets, jewelry and rattles, and bronze in 90% copper". Beyond his role as a renowned artist, Dempsey Bob has played an important part in inspiring the next generation of Northwest Coast artists. He is the senior advisor at the Northwest Community College (NWCC) Freda Diesing School of Northwest Coast Art.</p>
